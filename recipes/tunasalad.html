    <h2>A chilled tuna salad with your favorite vegetables!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb box of your pasta of choice (rotini or shells work great)</li>
        <li>1 Large can of SOLID tuna, chunk light is <em>GROSS!</em></li>
        <li>1/3 cup of Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/2 of a small white onion, or 1/4 of a large white onion</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp dill</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>A green vegetable of your choice (peas, celery, olives are all great)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring your water to a boil (enough water to fully cover the pasta plus an inch)</li>
        <li>While the water boils, combine the tuna and mayo in a separate bowland mash together with a spoon or fork</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta fully. Al dente is not desirable when chilled</li>
        <li>Dice or chop your onion based on your preference</li>
        <li>If your vegetables are raw, blanche or cook them (blanching is best to maintain crunchiness)</li>
        <li>Let everything cool, you can put in the fridge to expedite this</li>
        <li>Combine the pasta tuna mix, and vegetables in a large bowl, and add your seasonings</li>
        <li>If necessary you can add more mayo for creaminess, or more seasonings</li>
    </ol>
